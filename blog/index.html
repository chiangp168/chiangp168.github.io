        <h1> Camping at Salmon La Sac Campground </h1>
        <p>As you may already know, I love going camping in the summer of Seattle. It has my favorite kind of
            weather. A weather with sunny blue sky, gental breeze and most importantly, 0% chance of rain. In the
            summer of 2020, we went camping at Salmon Lac Sac, a campground only 2 hours away from Bellevue.
        </p>
        <p>As soon as we set up our tent at the campground, we went on a hike to Iron Bear - Teanaway Ridge Trail. 
            I indeed, saw a bear there!</p>

        <p>The trail is 6.5 miles round trip, and 1900ft gain in elevation. As always, all the sweat and hardwork became
            worth it when reaching the top of the mountain.</p>

        <p>We also took a dip in the natural swimming hole. It took us an hour before we could finally submerge our whole 
            body under this cold snow water from the top of the mountain.</p>

        <p>Of course, the camping trip is not complete without a bonefire and smores.</p>

        <p>I also highly recommend going to Cooper Lake for a tranquil lake experience. Perfect for kayaking or fishing!</p>
